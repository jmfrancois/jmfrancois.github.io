title: Mylyn makes Eclipse run out of memory

This week I have discovered that the Mylyn project is included in most Eclipse bundles. But this plugin makes Eclipse starve for memory... By the menu Window->Preferences->Show heap status, I have discovered the Acceleo bundle starting with a need of 180 MB with nothing opened. With a common Eclipse (PyDev, WTP), my Eclipse has a heap status of 35 MB. With my project of creating a Plone 2.5 generator with Acceleo, I want to have a UML editor (Papyrus or Topcased?) and Acceleo running perfectly.

You can find some pages about this memory problem with Mylyn: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mylyn2/

So start your Eclipse, take a coffee, and then go to Help->Software and Updates->Manage Configuration. Deactivate all Mylyn integration plugins to be able to deactivate the Mylyn plugin itself. Then restart your Eclipse, it's OK.

With the Acceleo bundle, I have deactivated Subversive and Mylyn, I'm now around 40 MB on the heap status. Now I'm ready to make UML diagrams.
