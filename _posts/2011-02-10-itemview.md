The idea is simple. Let Plone manage the content and the portlet be simply a small browser view.

Plone is content-centric, but a web page needs to display more than the current content. This is why I have created this add-on. The add form lets you choose one content item (like in the collection portlet) and a view mode. The default view covers all Plone content types.

There are many examples to cover, to show you how simple it is to use and to add support for.
I have already added conditional support with collective.gallery. So now you can choose a content item to act as a gallery in a portlet (link, folder or topic + 'Gallery' view in Itemview portlet). The same has been done on nmd.plonelinkasvideoembed, so you can publish a video from a link content item.

Comments and feedback are welcome!
