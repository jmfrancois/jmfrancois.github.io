title: How to add a random time between two emails sent from zope.sendmail

I’m using collective.dancing for a mass mailing: +8000 emails to send.

One of the questions is how to not be blacklisted? A first thing I have done today is to add a random time between two sends.

To achieve this I have read the code of zope.sendmail. It is a well-documented egg so it is not hard to understand how it works:

* A maildir (a directory) stores mails in files ready to be sent
* A mailer (a utility) is ready to be called to send emails one by one
* A queue mail delivery (utility) is ready to put messages inside a maildir
* A mailqueue processor (not a component, a thread implementation) parses every 3 seconds if there are new emails to send in the mailbox

So to achieve this you just have to unconfigure the plone.smtp utility and declare a new utility called plone.smtp with this code:

```python
import random
import time

from zope.sendmail import mailer

class SMTP(mailer.SMTPMailer):
    """Override SMTPMailer to let a random time"""

    def send(self, fromaddr, toaddrs, message):
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0,2))
        super(SMTP, self).send(fromaddr, toaddrs, message)
```

It’s working !
