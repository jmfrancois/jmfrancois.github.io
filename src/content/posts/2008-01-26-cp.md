When you use the command line, and you know how to use it, you can be a lot more powerful in making today's tasks than with a common window manager. For example, when you want to copy/paste a folder from one path to another, the command line is really faster.

    $ cp myfolder /path/to/another

cp command is really simple to learn and to use, compared to the rsync command, but rsync is a lot faster. So I want to show you a tip to fake cp using rsync. You just have to make an alias. On my laptop I'm using OpenSUSE 10.3, so I just edit the file '.alias' in my home folder to put this in it:

    alias cp=”rsync -az”

Now I'm continuing to use cp, but faster than you ;)
