title: A first shot at Eclipse XML templates

Most text types in Eclipse can be templated through the Window->Preferences menu. Those templates can next be imported/exported. I have made a first shot for my work on Plone, because next week I have a lot of profiles to write for some old-style products. [My first shot is available here under GNU GPL license](http://jm406.free.fr/downloads/eclipse-xml-template-plone-profiles-01.tar.bz2).

Those xml templates are for:

cssregistry.xml
factorytool.xml
jsregistry.xml
skins
types/MyTypes.xml
types.xml
workflows.xml
The rest will come later:

workflows/MyWF/definitions.xml
toolset
rolemap
properties
propertiestool
memberdata_properties
mailhost
import_step
export_step
control_panel
contenttyperegistry
catalog
action_icons
actions
As I have said, this one is a first shot, done in one hour, just to test, so now it needs to be improved.
