Plone has lots of features. collective.remove is a project to remove some features from Plone and be useful to integrators.

Why? My customers don't need them and for performance purposes, it's good to remove things not used.

What? This project has three eggs at the moment:

* collective.remove.kss
* collective.remove.kupu
* collective.remove.rules

To know what to remove, it's per project need. For example, I'm using TinyMCE on my last project, so I have removed Kupu. Vincent Fretin tells me the rules tab permission check is slow and I don't need it. Limi has tweeted that KSS makes Plone slower so I have removed it.

The goal is to remove one thing at a time when a feature is not needed. Most of the time I was doing this in the policy but I have written the same thing multiple times, so let's release it in a reusable package.

It is more than uninstall profiles. It is uninstall packages.
