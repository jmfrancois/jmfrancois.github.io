Today I attended a conference about Alfresco and MDA by BlueXML. What I have discovered is a set of software tools built with Eclipse and Acceleo to generate an Alfresco project (configure the portal, create content types, etc.). I have been really interested in the fact that they have created a new meta-model derived from UML to model an ECM project and also a GUI modeler associated with this meta-model.

That means the meta-model can also be used for Plone 3. For example, configuring Plone by creating user groups, permissions, workflows, etc., would be features available if we use it. But first, I need to test it to validate the usability of this meta-model and of the modeler. All is available at the BlueXML home site.
