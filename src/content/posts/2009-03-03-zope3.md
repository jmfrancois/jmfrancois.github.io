I just want to try to make a simple application with the best of current open-source technologies. I'll give it a try with these ones:

* Python 2.5
* Zope 3.4
* PostgreSQL 8.3
* SQLAlchemy 0.5
* YUI 2.7
* ZODB in PostgreSQL with RelStorage

I have taken an hour to install this on my laptop, with the excellent virtualenv to build a copy of an already installed Python in a directory.

    /path/2/python/bin/virtualenv --no-site-packages /path/2/project

Next, I have used zopeproject to install the latest Zope 3 technologies. Now zopeproject uses the KGS to set the version of eggs to use.

```
cd  /path/2/project
source bin/activate
easy_install zopeproject
zopeproject myproject
```

You get it, you have the latest release of Zope 3.4. Now add the eggs you want to use

```ini
eggs = ...
       psycopg2
       RelStorage
       ore.alchemist
       hurry.zopeyui
       z3c.form
#       chameleon.zpt require zope.i18n > 3.4
```

modify your zope.conf to configure RelStorage:

```xml
%import relstorage
<zodb>
  <relstorage>
    <postgresql>
      # The dsn is optional, as are each of the parameters in the dsn.
      dsn dbname='zope' user='zope' host='localhost'
    </postgresql>
  </relstorage>
</zodb>
```

Now, you've got your Zope 3.4 running on Python 2.5 and storing the ZODB data in PostgreSQL. I have lost most of the time on RelStorage and PostgreSQL configuration. I'm ready to work with all those technologies.

I will work on making a simple blog in pure Zope 3, and next I will try to make the same application with SQLAlchemy.
